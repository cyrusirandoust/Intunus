# Intunus
Welcome to Intunus, a collection of secret codes and scripts I’ve developed over the past six years to make life easier in the world of Intune. From taming unruly printers (yes, you’re still on my list) to automating tedious tasks, this open-source project is my way of sharing the magic that’s helped me streamline workflows and reclaim time.
