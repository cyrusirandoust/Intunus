# Intunus: Automate the Mundane, Master the Modern Workplace

Welcome to **Intunus**, an open-source collection of scripts and codes that Iâ€™ve built over the last six years to automate the tasks we all dread and simplify life in the world of Microsoft Intune.

## Why "Intunus"?
The name combines **Intune** (my favourite playground for modern workplace management) and **Cyrus** (yes, thatâ€™s me!). Together, it represents my journey of turning frustration into innovation and manual tasks into streamlined solutions.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
This repository is an ongoing project, with new scripts and tools added regularly. Each folder is dedicated to a specific project or automation, covering topics like:

- **Printer Wrangling**: Say goodbye to printer-related headaches.
- **Device Management Hacks**: Clever ways to get the most out of Intune.
- **Daily Automation**: Scripts to save time and sanity.
- **And much more!**

## Why I Created Intunus
Letâ€™s face it: some tasks are just plain annoying (looking at you, printers). Over the years, Iâ€™ve written countless scripts to automate these pains away or make my work life easier. Intunus is my way of sharing these solutions with the world, whether youâ€™re a fellow Intune enthusiast, an IT admin, or just someone who wants to work smarter.

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders to find a project that interests you.
2. Each folder contains its own README explaining what the script does and how to use it.
3. Download, adapt, and enjoy!

## Contribute
This is a collaborative space! If you have ideas, improvements, or your own scripts to share, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Roadmap
- Expand existing projects.
- Add new automation scripts regularly.
- Improve documentation for easier onboarding.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress. Scripts are provided as-is, so please test them in a safe environment before deploying them in production. Use at your own risk.
